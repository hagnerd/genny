# Genny

While working on a project that required the creation of multiple files that
followed similar naming patterns when creating a new component, I got inspired
to create a CLI utility that could handle creating flexible structures. This is
mostly to scratch my own itch.

help contributing, in any way at all, whether it is documentation, technical
writing, artwork, reviewing pull requests, you name it, just reach out. Open an
issue and I'll get back to you when I can.
